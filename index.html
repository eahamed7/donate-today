        <p>By donating to our Bangladesh Floods Appeal, you can provide a lifeline to the thousands of children, women,
            men, and elders who without our help, will face a life without their fundamental needs, let alone their
            livelihoods, homes and precious belongings.</p>

                <p>Being trapped and surrounded by deep floodwater means people are unable to access basic essentials,
                    and the little supplies they do have are quickly running out. The strong winds and heavy rain
                    continue to put lives and property at risk. Entire livelihoods, cattle and farmland are destroyed,
                    leaving people with absolutely nothing. Please help us help them, today.</p>

                <h3>They need us to suvive</h3>
                <p>Each year, heavy monsoon rains threaten millions of lives across South Asia. This year’s monsoon
                    season is getting worse by the day, causing widespread damage across Bangladesh. Communities have
                    lost their homes, livelihoods and lack access to essential food, water, and basic medical
                    assistance.
                    Our team is working with partners on the ground to provide life-saving support to those whose
                    lives have been torn apart this monsoon season.</p>
